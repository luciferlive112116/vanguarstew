"""Assess whether repeated benchmark runs of the same config are stable ("re-runs are stable").

``run_replay`` is deterministic given a fixed seed, but a real acceptance run varies with
model/inference noise across repeats. ``trend`` tracks a score over *successive* runs to catch a
regression; this measures the **spread of several *repeated* runs of the same config** — is the
benchmark reproducible enough to trust a single number? (ROADMAP M1 acceptance: "re-runs are
stable.")

Given N artifacts (the repeats), ``assess_repeatability`` reports mean / stddev / min / max /
range and the **coefficient of variation** (stddev / |mean|), and calls the set *stable* when the
CV is at or below a threshold and there are enough repeats. The companion
``scripts/repeatability.py`` exits non-zero when the runs are unstable, so reproducibility can be
gated in CI the way ``--fail-under`` gates a score.

Pure analysis: no I/O, never mutates its inputs, and an artifact with no usable score is skipped
(contributes nothing) rather than raising.
